# runge-kutta4-cpp
Implementation of the Runge-Kutta 4th order algorithm
to solve a 2nd order differential equation with initial conditions. 

This particular piece of code solves the equation for a damped harmonic 
oscillator but can be easily altered to solve any 2nd order differential
equation with initial conditions.

The output is written to a .txt file and its up to you to process it or visualize it.
